## Arbitrum Onboard & Explore
Migrate in Minutes. Understand in Seconds.

### 1) Executive Summary (≤ 400 chars)
A zero/low‑code migration engine plus an interactive transaction visualizer for Arbitrum. Projects seamlessly migrate from Ethereum/other L2s, then instantly analyze and showcase flows with ChainStory‑style graphs. Improves dev productivity, transparency, and the Arbitrum brand. Budget: $25,000. Timeline: ~12 weeks.

### 2) Problem
- Migration to Arbitrum is slowed by manual refactors and environment setup.
- Post‑migration, teams lack easy visual tools to debug and explain transactions.
- The DAO needs measurable, public‑facing artifacts that highlight Arbitrum’s advantages.

### 3) Solution — Onboard (WarpBridge) + Explore (ChainStory)
- Onboard: Scan contracts, flag Arbitrum‑specific optimizations, automate deploy & verify on Arbitrum One and Stylus.
- Explore: Interactive, replayable tx graphs with token flows, gas heatmaps, and public/private share links.
- Ecosystem Showcase: Curated, public visualization gallery for high‑profile projects.

### 4) Key Features
- Migration Engine
  - Contract scanner & compatibility checks (Solidity and Stylus‑ready patterns)
  - Optimization hints (gas/L2 patterns), auto‑deployment & verification
  - Configurable plans for multi‑contract projects
- Visual Forensics
  - Graph view: CALL/CREATE, token flows (ERC‑20/721/1155), gas usage by frame
  - Replay mode: step‑through timeline; call stack and revert paths
  - Public/private modes; signed, revocable share links
- Ecosystem Showcase
  - Side‑by‑side Ethereum vs Arbitrum comparisons (gas/time)
  - Gallery of public “transaction stories”; analytics for DAO reports

### 5) Technical Architecture
- Next.js App Router UI + API routes
- CLI + SDK for migration (`src/arb-migrate`) with Hardhat/Ethers
- Tracing adapters (Tenderly/Blockscout/debug) feeding normalized `TxGraph`
- Storage: local JSON snapshots (MVP), S3‑ready later
- Security: private by default; signed tokens for public snapshots

### 6) Milestones & Budget (Total $25,000)
1. Research & Architecture — 2 weeks — $3,000
   - Technical spec, adapter strategy, UX wireframes, data model (`TxGraph`, `Snapshot`)
2. Migration Engine MVP — 4 weeks — $7,000
   - Contract scanner, hints, deploy/verify pipeline (Arbitrum One + Stylus), sample templates
3. Visualizer MVP — 4 weeks — $7,000
   - Tx graph, replay timeline, token flows, public/private sharing, side‑by‑side compare
4. Ecosystem Showcase — 2 weeks — $5,000
   - Public gallery, DAO metrics endpoints, seeded demos, light docs
5. Testing & Launch — 2 weeks — $3,000
   - QA, perf polish, accessibility, documentation, partner onboarding guide

### 7) Deliverables
- CLI + SDK for migration (docs, examples)
- Visualizer web app with replay and shareable links
- Side‑by‑side comparison view (Sepolia ↔ Arbitrum Sepolia)
- Analytics endpoints + dashboard for DAO reporting
- Public demo gallery (≥ 6 projects/transactions)

### 8) Success Metrics (first 6 months)
- ≥ 20 projects onboarded to Arbitrum
- ≥ 1,000 transactions visualized
- ≥ 10 public “transaction stories” published
- Reported average gas savings and time savings across featured projects

### 9) Risks & Mitigations
- Trace availability/perf: Prefer Tenderly/Blockscout; debug RPC fallback; depth‑limiting & node collapsing
- Compatibility variance: Start with Ethereum + top L2s; expand iteratively
- Adoption: Coordinate with Arbitrum DevRel for early partners and gallery seeding

### 10) Team
- Lead Dev/PM (EVM, Arbitrum): migration tooling, performance optimization
- Frontend/UX (data viz): React, React Flow/Cytoscape, Next.js
- Blockchain Engineer: Solidity/Stylus, deployment & verification, adapters

### 11) Maintenance & Licensing
- MIT/Apache‑2 for the core toolkit and visualizer
- Ongoing upkeep funded via optional “pro” tier (bulk API, org workspaces), sponsorships, and future grants

### 12) Timeline (≈12 weeks)
- Weeks 1–2: Spec, UX, data model; adapter plan
- Weeks 3–6: Migration Engine MVP
- Weeks 7–10: Visualizer MVP + compare view
- Weeks 11–12: Gallery, analytics, QA, docs, launch

### 13) DAO Value
- Pull: Low‑friction migration
- Stickiness: Visual debugging & transparency tooling
- Brand lift: Public, beautiful transaction maps
- Metrics‑ready: Clear reporting of migrations, usage, and impact
